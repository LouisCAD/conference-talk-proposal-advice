# The CFP

## How should I choose the conference?

It's all about the content or topic of your talk. [Ted Neward](https://twitter.com/tedneward)'s [Speaking Tips: How to Write Good Proposals](http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/speaking-tips-proposals/) covers this nicely - about working out if your proposal is right for the scope of the conference.

Conference organiser [Mark Sellors](https://twitter.com/sellorm) suggests:

> Think about the nature of the conference you’re applying for - big vs small, academic vs non-academic etc.
Try to consider the type of conference you’re submitting to. There are many types of conferences; big, small, commercial, non-commercial, general conferences on a wide range of topics, niche conferences that focus on a specific area. Each will have their own sets of things that they’ll be looking for in a conference submission. Not all conferences are equal, and you may have something to say that would be rejected by one conference but accepted by another. Think about what you want to say and who might be interested in hearing it, then submit your proposal for conferences you think are the best fit for both. For example, a talk about using docker for data pipelines might not be technical enough for Dockercon, but could be ideal for a data conference, so try to think of as many angles to your abstract submission as you can.

## How many submissions should I make?

When it comes to how many proposals to submit to one conference, think carefully about the impression you're giving the committee members who are reviewing the submissions.

> Don't spam the submission queue. Sometime the same submission is sent to several tracks in hopes that one of them sticks.

As a rule of thumb, up to 3 submissions is good. 26 minutes 35 seconds into the [Java Council](javacouncil.com) podcast [episode 14](https://soundcloud.com/vjug), this is discussed from the perspective of the Program Committee, who will be rating and selecting the submissions.

## As a new speaker, how can I make my proposal stand out?

Absolutely film yourself. Whether, as [Trisha Gee](https://twitter.com/trisha_gee) suggests in the Java Council podcast, this is at a local meetup by your friend on an iPhone, or professionally filmed, any material of you speaking is good material. Program Committee members are looking for evidence that you can string a sentence together and effectively communicate. 

Another option, if you have no examples of yourself being filmed, is to make a kind of trailer. Prepare a short demo showing what you intend to talk about. 3-5 minutes should be enough. Include some slides and tell them about the key points of your presentation. You can upload this to YouTube as 'unlisted' and paste a copy of the link with your submission, in private notes to the Program Committee.

## What is the Committee looking for?

What is the Program Committee(PC) looking for?

Speaker and Program Committee member for Devoxx conferences, [Roy van Rijn](https://twitter.com/royvanrijn):
 
> Being a PC is all about the story you want to tell, most of the time there is a clear direction you want all the talks to have. For example this Devoxx season the focus is on Machine Learning, and I'm first filtering on what frameworks/ideas are being discussed. After that I'm looking for an abstract that fits those ideas, hard to say what is good/bad, it has to hit a trigger... and it has to be clear and not too concise.

> So if you want one or two Spring talks, I look at those abstracts and compare them. By topic. So you don't have to have the best abstract, just the best abstract about the topic you want to talk about :)
