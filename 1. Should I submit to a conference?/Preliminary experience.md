# Getting some experience

## Where to practise

Before you get to the conference stage, it is essential to get some practise first. This is an almost universal rule of thumb.

Luckily, there are many ways to do this.

Conference organiser [Mark Sellors](https://twitter.com/sellorm) suggests:

> - Volunteer to speak at a local [meet up group](https://www.meetup.com/), this is a great way to gain experience and it’s usually much easier to get a talk accepted at a regular meet up than it is a full blown conference - This will also raise your profile in the community.
- No interesting meet ups near you? Start one! They’re a great way to meet people and practice your speaking.
- Try to arrange a talk at your place of work on a topic of interest to your colleagues.
- Practice at home on friends or for a video camera.

## Why get practice

As well as preparing you for a conference proposal, and gaining confidence, you can use the opportunity to film yourself.
