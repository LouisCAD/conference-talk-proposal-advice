# Getting some experience

## Where to speak first

Before you get to the stage where you are going to submit a talk to a conference, it is essential to get some practice. This is an almost universal rule of thumb.

Luckily, there are many ways to do this.

Conference organiser [Mark Sellors](https://twitter.com/sellorm) suggests:

> - Volunteer to speak at a local [meet up group](https://www.meetup.com/), this is a great way to gain experience and it’s usually much easier to get a talk accepted at a regular meet up than it is a full blown conference - This will also raise your profile in the community.
> - No interesting meet ups near you? Start one! They’re a great way to meet people and practice your speaking.
> - Try to arrange a talk at your place of work on a topic of interest to your colleagues.
> - Practice at home on friends or for a video camera.

## Why get experience

As well as preparing you for a conference and gaining confidence, you can use the opportunity to film yourself. This will strengthen your proposal.
