# When in my career should I consider speaking at a conference?

Should you wait until you are a bonafide expert? Consensus is... no! 

Listen to episode 14 of the [Java Council podcast](https://soundcloud.com/vjug). In the episode, [Trisha Gee](https://twitter.com/trisha_gee), Developer Advocate at JetBrains, explains:

> "A conference session is only an hour long, maximum... Most people there listening to your talk... have a very high level of knowledge and you're there to give them an hour's insight into something that they don't know about. So you don't have to know everything. You just have to give them enough information so if they're interested, they can go and find out more."

There is no benchmark in your career when you should consider speaking. There is no "when I'm 10 years in..." rule. This is good, because there is no experience barrier. However it's also more difficult to judge, because you have to ask yourself, *do I have something to share, that would be useful to other people?* 

I'd argue that the chances are - yes, you do have something. However sometimes it takes time and is difficult to realise what this something is. Remember, there is always someone at the same stage or earlier in their learning than you. 

For example, if you just worked out how to hash and encrypt something in Java, the chances are someone else doesn't know how to do that. If you just understood what configuration over convention is, well that took me a while. If you managed to find harmony in a difficult team, congratulations, many teams never reach that stage. If you can navigate the weird and wonderful syntax of a new language, well, there's an audience for you.

If you are unsure, first speak at local meetups. Second, consider co-presenting at a conference with someone else. Another option, as speaker [Andrew Harmel-Law](https://twitter.com/al94781) suggests, is an unconference:
> If you're unsure, start with an unconference. There *everyone* is a speaker, inc you. You're co-presenting. You'll add tons.
