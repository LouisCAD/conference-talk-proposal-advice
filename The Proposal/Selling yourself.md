There are (at least!) 2 good styles of proposal. One is informative: like “How to set up Docker within Kubernetes”, with an abstract that outlines exactly what the talk will be about. The other one is provocative: like “Chasing dreams”, with an abstract that captures your imagination.

Again, look at talks at conferences past – what caught your eye? Why?

## Example of a thought-provoking abstract

Title: From Tic Tac Toe to AlphaGo: Playing Games with AI and Machine Learning

Abstract:
Google's AlphaGo is an extraordinary breakthrough for Artificial Intelligence. The game of 19x19 Go has 1.74×10^172 unique positions and is about a 'googol' times harder to calculate than chess. Experts thought it would take at least another decade before AI would be able to beat the best human players. So how did Google tackle this problem? What algorithms did they use and how do they work?
