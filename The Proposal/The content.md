Speaker and Program Committee member for Devoxx conferences, among others.

**As a speaker**

I don't have any particular thoughts about writing abstracts, for me it is just trying to:
- Write about what I want to talk about (braindump)
- Get people interested in that topic

One thing I always do it throw about 10 different title ideas against other speakers (like Bert Jan) and discus what sticks/interests them

**As a program committee member**
 
Being a PC is all about the story you want to tell, most of the time there is a clear direction you want all the talks to have, for example this Devoxx season the focus is on Machine Learning, and I'm first filtering on what frameworks/ideas are being discussed. After that I'm looking for an abstract that fits those ideas, hard to say what is good/bad, it has to hit a trigger... and it has to be clear and not too concise.

So if you want one or two Spring talks, I look at those abstracts and compare them. By topic. So you don't have to have the best abstract, just the best abstract about the topic you want to talk about :)

Too much buzzwords without context for me is an alarm-trigger, also company names are a turn-off, I don't want sponsor talks.
